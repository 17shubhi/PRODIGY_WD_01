Task completed: PRODIGY_WD_01-Responsive landing page I have successfully completed my first task as a Web Development intern at Prodigy Infotech.

>In this task, I have created  a stylish, scroll-interactive navigation menu with sections like About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact, styled using CSS and made dynamic with JavaScript.

>An Interactive Navigation Menu that: Has a fixed position, Changes style or color on scroll or hover.
Contains links like: Home, About, Portfolio, Services, Contact
JavaScript adds: Scroll-based background changes, Hover effects for navigation items.

>What i learned!
HTML: structure a webpage with nav and sections.
CSS: Style a fixed navbar, add hover effects, transitions.
JavaScriptâ€‹: Detect scroll, dynamically update styles.
Web design: Build an interactive, clean, real-world layout.

>Personal reflection:

>This is also my first internship and my first task in web development. Through this task i also learned: how to use GitHub, how to post and share work on LinkedIn, why do we use platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn in a professional setting.
Although i had some basic knowledge about these tools before, this internship helped me gain a much clearer understanding of their importance and practical use.

>I would like to thank Prodigy Infotech for giving me this opportunity to learn and grow.I'm looking forward to completing more task and improving my skills!

Thankyou!
